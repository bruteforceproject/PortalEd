# Synopsis

PortalEd is an web based application that allows teachers to be more closely connected with the parents and guardians of their students. Teachers can notify their students guardians on their attendance, behavior, and academic progress with the tap of a button using a traffic light based color scheme. 

Often teachers and school faculty will send students home with paper slips indicating that their student has received an infraction, but they have no way of knowing if the guardians will see these papers or be the ones signing them. This application gives notifications to parents and guardians and prompts them to acknowledge their child's behavior, attendance, or academic alerts. This makes it so the parents and guardians are more involved in their students' education and that they get the necessary information to maximize their child's success.

This app also shows a students overview so that guardians, teachers, and councelors can be given the proper information to address any areas that may be of concern. This area will show the average score for the behavior, attendance, and academics of a student.
